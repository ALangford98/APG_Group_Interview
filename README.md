# APG_Group_Interview
Join my group for the APG assignment by completing these tasks.


# Task Overview #
# 1. Install Visual Studio on a Windows Computer. C++ programs are platform dependant and therefore difficult to develop for multiple platforms. We will be developing a graphics rendering application for the x86 framework on Visual Studio. 
# 2. Ensure that C++ is installed and that you are able to compile and run applications. 
# 3. Download and deploy the 32-bit Windows Binaries for the GLFW library to a project. You should be able to compile and run projects using the " #include <GLFW/glfw3.h> " statement in your project. to do this, you will have to learn how to include external dependencies on a project and handle any errors those dependencies may cause. Generally when installing dependencies, they rely on other libraries which must also be installed. Pay attention to your output window when compiling your program as it will show you what dependencies are still needed for the application to run.
# 4. Create a rendering window where graphics can be rendered. Note that this is not a terminal window but instead a windows form where one could create GUI applications.
# 5. Render a triangle of any size to the window. This is to demonstrate that you have a basic understanding of the library and the C++ language as a whole. 
# 6. Once complete, submit your project files to this repo. Also include a screenshot of your desktop with the window displaying the rendered triangle. The first 3 people to complete the installation of GLFW and submit their solution may join my group and we will move foreward with the development of the application for the assignment.

# I am doing this to avoid being grouped with people who are not willing to learn and instead just want to tag along. For reference material, you should use these C++ and OpenGL tutorial series' on YouTube:

# You dont need to watch all the videos in this series but they are great resources for what we are doing in this project.
